# Web Development with Python
- A simple repo dedicated to keep track of my web development work with Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap and etc 🚀.
- Continued from [this repo](https://github.com/Damsith-LK/Udemy-Projects-Python-2)


## Flask Steps for running a web server 🚀

1. Set the environmental variable **FLASK_APP** to the name of flask file: `set FLASK_APP=something.py` (This command is for windows)
2. Run that flask app using the command `flask run`
      ```
      flask run
       * Serving Flask app 'C:\Users\Sampath Wijekoon\PycharmProjects\Web-Development-with-Python\my_first_flask.py'
       * Debug mode: off
      WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
       * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
      Press CTRL+C to quit
      ```
   or with `app.run()` in the python file
